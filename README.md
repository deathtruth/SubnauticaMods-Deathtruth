# Adjustable Fire Extinguisher
- Allows you to adjust the output of the fire extinguisher
- Useful for getting to the surface quickly and escaping agressive creatures
- Generally fun to scoot around with when the regulator is set to max!
- Fixes vanilla bug where fire extinguishers never show 0% fuel
- Configurable adjustment hotkey and ability to mute the sound played when changing your release pressure (Default is F, with vanilla output force of 5 units)
- Supports Version Checker by Tobey Blaber

This is my first subnautica mod so please give me feedback!

# No Rebreather Sounds
- Removes the annoying/frightening distant horn sound which comes from the player's rebreather.

Here is a video of the sound:

This mod removes it.

# Silent Walking
- Mod options allow you to enable/disable walking sounds your character makes when walking on metal (inside habitats) on land and on Precursor surfaces. 
- Options can be changed in game at any time using the mod config menu. No restart required.

# Silent Base Ambience
- Mute the scanner room ambient background music via the ingame menu/config file.
- Mute the generic "indoor sounds" you hear in the habitat via the ingame menu/config file.
