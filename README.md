# Adjustable Fire Extinguisher
- Allows you to adjust the output of the fire extinguisher
- Useful for getting to the surface quickly and escaping agressive creatures
- Generally fun to scoot around with when the regulator is set to max!
- Fixes vanilla bug where fire extinguishers never show 0% fuel
- Configurable adjustment hotkey and ability to mute the sound played when changing your release pressure (Default is F, with vanilla output force of 5 units)
- Supports Version Checker by Tobey Blaber

This is my first subnautica mod so please give me feedback!

# No Rebreather Sounds
- Removes the annoying/frightening distant horn sound which comes from the player's rebreather.

Here is a video of the sound:

-Options can be changed in game at any time using the mod config menu. No restart required.
